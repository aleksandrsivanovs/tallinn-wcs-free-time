## Transportation
General proposed way of exploring Tallinn is _on foot_. 
However, it might rain or you are tired and etc - then it's _public transport_ or  _Uber_. 

Public transport is [quite expensive](www.tallinn.pilet.ee/buy) for guests. It starts to make sense if you take daily or more ticket.

If it's small amount of short trips or if there are at least two of you - then in the end, you most probably will pay the same amount in Uber and in public transport. 

Also, with Uber you get a chance to ride in TeslaS, latest Audi's, Lexus'es or BMW's?
It's true fact that Uber presented Tallinn with 3 Tesla S, there is also rumor that there is Uber Tesla X :)

## Walking

### Old Town
Walk up to the Toompea hill, get to the viewing platforms and take a look at Tallinn panoramas of Old Town's rooftops and towers against the backdrop of the modern city skyline:
* [Patkuli viewing platform](https://goo.gl/maps/GWRzXLLT9Qv)
* [Kohtuotsa viewing platform](https://goo.gl/maps/u7aiNmHvm1o)
* [Piiskopi viewing platform](https://goo.gl/maps/bAv7RnHCUNH2)

_Pro-tip:_ you can meet the Seagull on Patkulli or Kohtuotsa viewing platforms. This Seagull is very photogenic and for some reason not afraid of people, and because of that [became quite popular](https://www.google.ee/search?q=seagull+tallinn+old+town&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjB5Ne6nZXTAhWCCpoKHSCeDM0Q_AUIBigB&biw=1637&bih=953#imgrc=_). 

While walking down from Toompea hill, enjoy nice views of old city and get some of Tallinn back home from [souvenir and design shops](#souvenirs-and-design-shops).

Don't forget to get to [Raekoja plats](https://goo.gl/maps/QtPX4Es7BkG2) and grab some [spiced almonds](http://www.spottedbylocals.com/tallinn/olde-hansa-spiced-almonds) near [Olde Hansa](http://www.oldehansa.ee/?lang=en).

### [Kadriorg park](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/kadriorg-park)
Kadriorg is Estonian for "Catherine's Valley". People from St. Petersburg will notice something very familiar - the place is built around Catherinethal, a Baroque palace of Catherine I of Russia (_attention:_ don't think of this as "palace" in Peterhof way, this is roughly 100x times smaller).
Very nice park to walk around and relax. Recommendation is to walk up to [Japanese Garden](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/japanese-garden-in-kardiorg-park), however, not sure it will be at it's full potential in April :)

_Pro-tip:_ grab the best coffee in Baltics in [Gourmet Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/GourmetCoffee.ee/) - the baristas know their work very well and selection of coffee is amazing.


### [Pirita beach](https://goo.gl/maps/KkMBRzJAtPA2)
[Pirita beach](https://goo.gl/maps/KkMBRzJAtPA2) and Pirita yacht marina - one of the best places to breathe in the air and relax.
Walk around, get to [the end of pier](https://goo.gl/maps/qskSZx5wYVm) and then walk by the beach (or using walking trail near the beach a bit inside the park)
You can get some food and coffee/drinks in the [Kalevi Yacht Club](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/kalevi-yacht-club).

_Pro-tip:_ personal favorites in Kalevi Yacht Club - smoked cheese soup and smoked eel

## Museums

### [Lennusadam museum](http://meremuuseum.ee/lennusadam/en/)
Sea history (ships & planes & submarines) museum. 
Very modern looking and nicely made exposition.

### [Tallinn TV Tower](http://www.teletorn.ee/en/)
A bit far, but nice views on Tallinn. For an additional fee, visitors can try the “Walking On The Edge” attraction at the top of the viewing platform. 

### [Kumu Art Museum](http://kumu.ekm.ee/en/)
A must-see for culture creatures, Kumu, the main building of Art Museum of Estonia, serves both as Estonia's national gallery and as a centre for contemporary art.

## Food delivery
It's possible to order the food from the same (and many more) restaurants and then couriers will bring it to your desired place.
However, before relying on this option - please check working time and delivery time of the order.
Some delivery companies:
* [Wolt](https://wolt.com/)
