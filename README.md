Biggest portal for getting information what to do in Tallinn is [Visit Estonia](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/).
Here we will list some of our favorite places and things to do in Tallinn. 

## Museums

### [Lennusadam museum](http://meremuuseum.ee/lennusadam/en/)
Sea history (ships & planes & submarines) museum. 
Very modern looking and nicely made exposition.

### [Tallinn TV Tower](http://www.teletorn.ee/en/)
A bit far, but nice views on Tallinn. For an additional fee, visitors can try the “Walking On The Edge” attraction at the top of the viewing platform. 

### [Kumu Art Museum](http://kumu.ekm.ee/en/)
A must-see for culture creatures, Kumu, the main building of Art Museum of Estonia, serves both as Estonia's national gallery and as a centre for contemporary art.

## Walking

### Old Town:
Walk up to the Toompea hill, get to the viewing platforms and take a look at Tallinn panoramas of Old Town's rooftops and towers against the backdrop of the modern city skyline:

* [Kohtuotsa viewing platform](https://goo.gl/maps/u7aiNmHvm1o)
* [Piiskopi viewing platform](https://goo.gl/maps/bAv7RnHCUNH2)

While walking down from Toompea hill, enjoy nice views of old city and get some of Tallinn back home from souvenir shops.

_Pro-tip:_ pesonal favourites souvenir/gift shops are small designer places like [Oma Asi](http://omaasi.com/#contacts)

Don't forget to get to [Raekoja plats](https://goo.gl/maps/QtPX4Es7BkG2) and grab some [spiced almonds](http://www.spottedbylocals.com/tallinn/olde-hansa-spiced-almonds) near [Olde Hansa](http://www.oldehansa.ee/?lang=en).

### [Kadriorg (Estonian for "Catherine's Valley") park](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/kadriorg-park). 
People from St. Petersburg will notice something very familiar - the place is built around Catherinethal, a Baroque palace of Catherine I of Russia (_attention:_ don't think of this as "palace" in Peterhof way, this is roughly 100x times smaller).
Very nice park to walk around and relax. Recomendation is to walk up to [Japanese Garden](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/japanese-garden-in-kardiorg-park), however, not sure it will be at it's full potential in April :)

_Pro-tip:_ grab the best coffee in Baltics in [Gourmet Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/GourmetCoffee.ee/) - the baristas know their work very well and selection of coffee is amazing.


### [Pirita beach](https://goo.gl/maps/KkMBRzJAtPA2)
[Pirita beach](https://goo.gl/maps/KkMBRzJAtPA2) and Pirita yacht marina - one of the best places to breathe in the air and relax.
Walk around, get to [the end of pier](https://goo.gl/maps/qskSZx5wYVm) and then walk by the beach (or using walking trail near the beach a bit inside the park)
You can get some food and coffee/drinks in the [Kalevi Yacht Club](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/kalevi-yacht-club).

_Pro-tip:_ personal favorites in Kalevi Yacht Club - smoked cheese soup and smoked eel
