# Kalamaja district
New cafes, bars and galleries have transformed the former industrial complexes of the historical wooden townhouse district, making it the fastest developing area of Tallinn attracting creatives and those young at heart.

Often called the “hipsterville” of Tallinn, this once closed off Soviet border zone is conveniently located between the scenic Tallinn coast and Old Town and hides some real architectural gems.

Old Town Swing 2017 will be held in the heart of Kalamaja - in [Salme Kultuurikeskus](http://salme.ee/) on [Salme tn. 12, Tallinn, 10413](https://goo.gl/maps/XJWeH2CZ7LD2)
