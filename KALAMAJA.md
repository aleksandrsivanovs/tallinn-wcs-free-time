# Kalamaja district
New cafes, bars and galleries have transformed the former industrial complexes of the historical wooden townhouse district, making it the fastest developing area of Tallinn attracting creatives and those young at heart.

Often called the “hipsterville” of Tallinn, this once closed off Soviet border zone is conveniently located between the scenic Tallinn coast and Old Town and hides some real architectural gems.

Telliskivi is the hub of Kalamaja with its many restaurants, theatres and an indoor shopping street selling everything from organic cosmetics to Estonian design. Nearby you’ll find Estonia’s largest and coolest maritime museum Seaplane Harbour as well as the once infamous Patarei sea fortress and prison, peeking into the dark history of the past Soviet occupation.

Old Town Swing 2017 will be held in the heart of Kalamaja - in [Salme Kultuurikeskus](http://salme.ee/) on [Salme tn. 12, Tallinn, 10413](https://goo.gl/maps/XJWeH2CZ7LD2)
